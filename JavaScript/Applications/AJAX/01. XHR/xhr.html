    <!-- 1. XHR (XmlHttpRequest) Your task is to write a JS function that loads a
    github repository asynchronously with AJAX. You should create an instance of
    XmlHttpRequest and attach an onreadystatechange event to it. (An
    EventHandler that is called whenever the readyState attribute changes).
    Obtain the data by making a GET request to the following URL:
    https://api.github.com/users/testnakov/repos. -->

    <body>
        <button id="load">Load Repos</button>
        <div id="res"></div>

        <script src="xhr.js"></script>
    </body>
