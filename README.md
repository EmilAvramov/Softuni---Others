# Repository housing problems and homework tasks

## Relates to Judge (SoftUni's testing system), where students need to write specific code to pass pre-built tests (input and output), or tasks where students need to build some basic web apps. Mostly for reference purposes of material covered (and for recordkeeping for myself)

- Some work done is not located in this repository (generally Web Modules and Projects).
- For some HTML/CSS and some JavaScript exercises the HTML/CSS skeleton is supplied by SoftUni in advance and specific tasks need to be performed on the skeleton.
- For DB courses, students need to create a specific DB based on instructions and perform different operations on the data.
